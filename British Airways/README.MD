✈️📊** British Airways Analysis**

A complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on British Airways customer reviews, built using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook.

PROBLEM STATEMENT British Airways faces the challenge of accurately forecasting lounge demand at Heathrow Terminal 3 amid changing flight schedules and fleet strategies. Traditional forecasting methods require precise flight- and aircraft-level data, which may not always be available. To address this, a scalable and flexible lookup model is needed to estimate lounge eligibility percentages across meaningful flight groupings, such as time of day, route type, and regional destination. This will enable the Airport Planning team to anticipate lounge usage, optimize capacity, and ensure premium service delivery for eligible customers.
