🏨📊 Airbnb Data Analysis — End-to-End Data Analytics Project

A complete and professional data analysis project exploring Airbnb listing trends, pricing behavior, location dynamics, and host activity. Built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook, this project delivers business-ready insights and is ideal for data science portfolios and interviews.

🎯 Problem Statement

When booking a stay on Airbnb, travelers often struggle to know if the price they’re paying is fair for the value they receive. Prices can vary widely even within the same location and room type, making it difficult to choose the best option. This analysis uses Airbnb data to help guests compare listings based on factors like location, room type, host verification, service fees, and availability. By identifying which listings offer the most value for their price, the project empowers travelers to make informed decisions, avoid overpaying, and enjoy the best possible stay within their budget. This analysis aims to:

Help travelers compare listings effectively

Reveal which factors influence pricing

Identify value-for-money listings

Reduce the chances of overpaying

Enable data-backed, confident booking decisions

By analyzing Airbnb data, this project empowers users to choose the best possible stay within their budget.
