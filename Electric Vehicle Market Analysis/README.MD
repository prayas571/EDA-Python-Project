🚗⚡ Electric Vehicle Market Analysis

A complete, end-to-end data analysis project exploring the global Electric Vehicle (EV) market. This project uses Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook to analyze EV adoption, growth, manufacturer performance, and feature relationships.

PROBLEM STATEMENT The rapid transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs) is a defining shift in India’s transportation sector. Traditional ICE vehicles significantly contribute to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and rising fuel dependency, which threaten environmental sustainability and energy security. With India targeting Net Zero emissions by 2070, EV adoption has become a strategic priority.

India’s heavy reliance on crude oil imports not only raises transportation costs but also exposes the economy to global price volatility. EVs, with their lower running costs and zero tailpipe emissions, offer a sustainable alternative. Government initiatives, including the FAME-II scheme, state-level subsidies, and GST reductions, have accelerated adoption, while advances in battery technology, charging infrastructure, and vehicle design are making EVs increasingly practical and affordable.

Despite this progress, EV adoption remains uneven across states, categories (2W, 3W, 4W, buses), and time periods. This project seeks to analyze EV market trends, growth patterns, and policy impacts to uncover key drivers, regional disparities, and future opportunities that can accelerate India’s transition to sustainable mobility.
